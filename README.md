# Hello World!

To get started, close this repository and:

- `uv sync` to install dependencies: if you are still using `pip`, you should switch to `uv`, and thank me later for forcing you to do it.
- Go to `llm/structured.py` and set the model to the one you want to use. We are using LiteLLM (https://www.litellm.ai/) as an interface. If you don't know how to use it, I'll show you in the lecture.
- Set the corresponding environment variables in `.env`.
