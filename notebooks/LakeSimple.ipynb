      "Row 2: ...H....\n",

      "Row 4: ...H....\n",
      "Row 5: .HH...H.\n",
      "Row 6: .H..H.H.\n",
      "Row 7: ...H...G\n",
      "\n",
      "So, P is at (0,0). The goal G is at (7,7), I think. Wait, actually, looking closer, each row has 8 columns, so maybe it's zero-indexed? Hmm, but regardless, the layout shows that there are multiple H's scattered around.\n",
      "\n",
      "From my starting position, I can move left, down, right, or up. But since I'm at the top-left corner (0,0), moving left or up would take me out of bounds, which is probably not allowed, so my options are down or right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at row 1, it's all safe tiles except for maybe some Hs later on. So if I move down to (1,0), that's safe because the initial rows don't have Hs until row 2 and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, moving right would take me to (0,1). Looking at row 0, from P onwards, it's all dots except maybe towards the end? Wait, no, in row 0, after P, there are six dots and then nothing else. So (0,1) is safe too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I have two options: down or right. Both seem safe on the first move. But which path is better? Let's think about the overall structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hs are spread out in rows 2 to 7. The bottom row has G at the end but also an H before it. So I need a path that avoids those Hs.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I move right, maybe I can find a more direct route towards the goal without having to go all the way down first. Alternatively, moving down might lead me into areas with more Hs as I proceed further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in row 5 and 6, there are multiple Hs on both sides. Maybe going straight down isn't the best idea because those rows have Hs that could block my path later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps moving right initially is better. Let's consider moving right to (0,1). From there, I can continue moving right or down. But again, I need to avoid the Hs in the lower rows.\n",

      "\n",
      "But wait, row 0 is clear except for P at (0,0) and dots elsewhere, so moving right seems safe until I reach a point where moving further might not be advisable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thought: maybe I should move down first to get away from the corner, as the initial Hs start appearing in row 2. So if I go down once, then perhaps I can move right more safely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but (1,0) is safe. From there, moving right would take me to (1,1), which is also a dot. But maybe that's not the most optimal path because as I go further down, rows 2 and beyond have Hs on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, it's a bit tricky. Let me try to sketch possible paths:\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 1: Right, Right, ..., Down, ..., Right to G.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking at row 0, moving right all the way would take me to (0,7), but then I can't move down much because rows below have Hs on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to move down until I reach row 1, then move right as far as possible before encountering an H, and then proceed accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's think about the bottom-right corner. The G is at (7,7), but there's an H in row 7 at column 5 or something? Wait no, looking back:\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 7: ...H...G. So positions (7,3) is H and (7,7) is G. So from the bottom-left, moving right towards G would require avoiding that H.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe a path that snakes through the grid, avoiding the Hs by going around them.\n",

      "\n",
      "Move 1: Right to (0,1).\n",

      "From there, can continue right or down. Maybe it's better to get to a higher column before going down to minimize exposure to Hs on the left side.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without knowing the exact layout beyond row 0, it's hard to say for sure.\n",
      "\n",
